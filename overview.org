#+TITLE: Summer Projection
#+OPTIONS: author: Kyle Kirk

This documentation is for the Go Summer Learning Project.

My intent is to document and learn go over the course of a summer to the point
where I can use Golang, Flutter and possibly a Rust backend to create an interactive
IDE "Code Teaching" program modeled after my summer of code learning.
