This documentation is for the Go Summer Learning Project.

My intent is to document and learn go over the course of a summer to the point
where I can use Golang, Flutter and possibly a Rust backend to create an interactive
IDE "Code Teaching" program modeled after my summer of code learning.

* Golang Learning Schedule

** Phase 1 [100%] [4/4]
   - [X] Golang Installation
   - [X] Golang working layer on Spacemacs (Possibly?)
   - [X] Go 'Hello World' : [[file:go/hw.go][here]] 
   - [X] Fundamentals of Programming [100%] [6/6]
     - [X] Variables
       - assign first (ex : `var x int` or `var x string')
       - need to further investigate strings tomorrow (05/23)
     - [X] Compilation/Running
       - [X] go run (runs script from file compiles at time(?) and if you want to make it an executable, go build)
       - [X] [[file:discovery.org::go-discovery-1][Golang Discovery 1]] (tags)
       - [X] Multiple files for one? Includes similar to C++? (Answer : Yes, just include them on the line or in a package together.
       - [X] [[file:discovery.org::#go-discovery-2][Golang Discovery 2]] (imports)
       - [X] chmod? Permissions needed to run script afterwards? (Answer : None, it's done automatically.)
       - [X] [[file:discovery.org::#go-discovery-3][Golang Discovery 3]] (testing)
     - [X] Logic (Loops, Ifs, Switch) : [[file:go/loop.go][here]]
     - [X] Go 'Acronym Creator' from [[https://exercism.io][Exercism]] website : [[file:go/acronym.go][here]] test cases are in go directory.
     - [X] Strings (how are they treated?)
     - [X] (Putting this off to Week 2) Slices when dealing with arrays, atomic and different than in C++. Investigate further.
** Phase 2 [100%] [4/4]
    - [X] Defer investigation : [[file:go/defer.go][here]]
    - [X] Classes & Data Structures : [[file:go/data_structs/main.go][here]] and [[file:go/data_structs/functions.go][here]]
