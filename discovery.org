# Things Discovered about Go :

* go-discovery-1
# Tags :
Build tags can be put in the file at the top in a line comment `// + build` and you can essentially execute all the build tags by running ```go build -tags="tag1, tag2"```
 appending *_test at the end of a file allows you to run ```go test``` and it will run that file with the files associated with it.

# Tests : 
You can actually create test files by appending _test to the end of the file name, for example
`hello_world.go` can have a test file 'hello_world_test.go` and you can run the test file with `go test` and it is recognized.
