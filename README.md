# orgfiles

Testing Emacs org mode for summer project flow control.

After uploading my dotfiles (here)[https://github.com/capktkirk/dotfiles] a friend of mine reached
out that I should try Spacemacs specifically because of the markdown, agenda driven capabilities of
org-mode mixed with Spacemacs customization.

Thus, my summer code program began. I decided that the only way to learn Spacemacs fully was to 
create a class like environment where I was learning a new programming language while integrating
my note-taking and coding into Spacemacs to get the full feel of it (as I do with nvim already)

That's where we are now. I will provide links to everything that I use and how far
I get.
